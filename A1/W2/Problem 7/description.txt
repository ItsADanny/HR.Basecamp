Positions on a chess board are identified by a letter and a number.
Usually, the letter identifies the column, while the number identifies the row.
Write a program that reads a position from the user.
The program should determine if the column begins with a black square or a white square.
Then use modular arithmetic (check if you know this concept) to report the color of the square in that row.

Criteria:
* Your program may assume that a valid position will always be entered

Input examples:
1. Position: D5
2. Position: A1

Output examples:
1. White
2. Black
