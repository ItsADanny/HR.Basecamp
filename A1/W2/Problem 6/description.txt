It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years.
However this simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two years.
As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog years.
Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years described in the previous paragraph.

Criteria:
* First 2 human years are 10.5 dog years per human year
* Each extra human year is 4 dog years per human year
* Ensure that your program works correctly for conversions of less than two human years and for conversions of two or more human years
* Your program should display an error message Only positive numbers are allowed if the user enters a negative number

Input examples:
1. Human years: 1
2. Human years: 4
3. Human years: -1

Output examples:
1. Dog years: 10.5
2. Dog years: 29
3. Only positive numbers are allowed
