A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user. Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.

Criteria:

* Input is given as a comma seperated string: a=5, b=6, c=5
* All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length.
* An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length.
* If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.

Input example:
Sides: a=5, b=6, c=5

Output example:
Isosceles triangle
