Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that.
As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years.
Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.

Criteria:
* Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
* Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
* Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
* All other years are not leap years.

Input examples:
1. Year: 2012
2. Year: 2011

Output examples:
1. Leap year
2. Not a leap year
