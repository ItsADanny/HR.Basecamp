There are numerous phrases that are palindromes when spacing is ignored.
Examples include “go dog”, “flee to me remote elf” and “some men interpret nine memos”, among many others.
Write a program that ignores spacing while determining whether or not a string is a palindrome

Extra (additional challenge):
* Extend your solution so that is also ignores punctuation marks (like , . ? ! ;)
* Extend your solution so that it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.

Input example:
1. Sentence: go dog
2. Sentence: some men interpret nine memos
3. Sentence: some random sentence

Output example:
1. "go dog" is a palindrome
2. "some men interpret nine memos" is a palindrome
3. "some random sentence" is not a palindrome
