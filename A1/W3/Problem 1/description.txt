A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward.
For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words.
Write a program that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determines whether or not it is a palindrome.
Display the result, including a meaningful output message.

Extra (additional challenge):
* Extend your solution so that is also ignores punctuation marks (like , . ? ! ;)
* Extend your solution so that it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.

Input example:
1. String: anna
2. String: hannah
3. String: lepels

Output example:
1. "anna" is a palindrome
2. "hannah" is a palindrome
3. "lepels" is not a palindrome
