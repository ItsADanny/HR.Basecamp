    12:00-12:30: My team and I started brainstorming ideas for our boardgame on site. We are considering using pygame to visualize our boardgame,
    so we will first spend some time getting familiar with pygame and its possibilities.

    12:30-13:00: We figured its best to stick to using the terminal for our boardgame, as we agreed pygame might be too much work as of right now
    and it would probably be better for something like a racing game rather than a board game.

    13:00-15:30: We managed to come up with a full concept for our boardgame and worked it out in a word document to have a good overview 
    of what we want to do and achieve. 

    1:00-22:00: I spent some time looking up python (board) game tutorials on youtube to get some inspiration and ideas to implement in our board
    game. 

Time spent today: 4,5 hours

    10:00-10:30: We started of the day by getting in a group call and discussing what we want to achieve today, and what each member would be
    focussing on. My goal is to finish a bare bones version of the dialogues and start coding, ideally the board will be done today.

    10:30-13:00: I will start off by further working out our word overview. We want to implement different dialogues in our game, so I will be 
    writing the dialogues etc.

    13:00-14:30: Trying to make the board. I was struggling to get something I was satisfied with, so I will wait and ask my team to help
    me tomorrow to explore further options.

    15:00-16:00: Writing more dialogue for the special fields.

Time spent today: 6 hours

    08:00-09:00: I started today by writing more dialogues for the special fields. 

    10:00-12:30: We had a quick standup on-site and shared what each member has done so far.
    we've made good progress, the startup screen of our boardgame is as good as finished. A good portion of classes is finished.
    I'm continuing with dialogues and starting to implement it into a class

    13:30-16:00: I helped Julian with rewriting his wordle code to make it work a bit better. 

Time spent today: 6 hours

-Friday 08/03/2024-
    09:00-14:00: I changed the wordle game to be a game of hangman
    15:00-17:00: Extra dialogues to have a good amount of variation within our game

Time spent today: 7 hours

-Monday 11/03/2024-
    10:00-13:00: Testing game and looking for potential bugs
    20:00-23:00: Debugging and adding final details with the group
