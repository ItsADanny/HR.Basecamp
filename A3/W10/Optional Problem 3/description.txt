{Optional problem}

Spelling mistakes are only one of many different kinds of errors that might appear in a written work.
Another error that is common for some writers is a repeated word.
For example, an author might inadvertently duplicate a word,
as shown in the following sentence: At least one value must be entered entered in order to compute the average.
Some word processors will detect this error and identify it when a spelling or grammar check is performed.
In this exercise you will write a program that detects repeated words in a text file.
When a repeated word is found your program should display a message that contains the line number and the repeated word.

Example:
------------------------------------------------------------
Found duplicate word [something] on line: 10
------------------------------------------------------------

Then the program must ask the user if the repeated word has to be removed or if it should find and
display the next instance of a duplicate word. The name of the examined file will be provided as the
programâ€™s only command line parameter.
Display an appropriate error message if the user fails to provide a command line parameter,
or if an error occurs while processing the file.
