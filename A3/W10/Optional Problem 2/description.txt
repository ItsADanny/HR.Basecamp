(Optional problem)

A password that contains random characters is a relatively secure password, but it is also difficult to memorize.
As an alternative, some systems construct a password by taking two English words and concatenating them.
While this password isnâ€™t as secure, it is much easier to memorize.
Write a program that reads a file (from input) containing a list of words, randomly selects two of them, and concatenates them to produce a new password.
When producing the password ensure that it has a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 10 characters, and that each word used is at least three letters long.
Capitalize each word in the password so that the user can easily see where one word ends and the next one begins.
Print the password for the user.
