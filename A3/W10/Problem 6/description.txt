When you write a function, it is a good idea to include a comment that outlines the functionâ€™s purpose,
its parameters and its return value. However, sometimes comments are forgotten,
or left out by well-intentioned programmers that plan to write them later but then never get around to it.

Create a python program that reads one or more Python source files and identifies functions
that are not immediately preceded by a comment.

Extra:
* For the purposes of this exercise, assume that any line that begins with def, followed by a space,
  is the beginning of a function definition.
* Assume that the comment character, #, will be the first character on the previous line when the function has a comment.
* Display the names of all of the functions that do not have a comment,
  along with the file name and line number where the function definition is located.
* The user will provide the names of one or more Python files as command line parameters (comma separated).

Input example (correct):
======================================================================================================
functiontest.txt
======================================================================================================

Output example (correct):
======================================================================================================
File: functiontest.txt contains a function [function_name_here()] on line [1] without a preceding comment.
File: functiontest.txt contains a function [another_function_name_here()] on line [15] without a preceding comment.

File: functiontest.txt contains a function [function_name_here()] on line [1] without a preceding comment.
File: functiontest.txt contains a function [another_function_name_here()] on line [15] without a preceding comment.
