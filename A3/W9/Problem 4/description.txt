Calculating distances in differente formats is hard, so we would like a program to do this for us.

Write a class called Converter.

Criteria:
* The user will pass a length and a unit when declaring an object
  from the classâ€”for example, c = Converter(9,'inches').
* For each of these units there should be a method that returns the length
  converted into those units. For example, using the Converter object created above,
  the user could call c.feet() and should get 0.75 as the result.
* Use meters as base unit to convert to and from (this prevents rounding errors)

Units:
* inches
* feet
* yards
* miles
* kilometers
* meters
* centimeters
* millimeters
