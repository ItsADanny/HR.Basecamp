One of the ways to measure the performance of pieces of a code is to measure the time of the execution.

Info:
For example, the time is recorded at the beginning and at the end of a function.
Then, the execution time can be calculated.
A desirable implementation is to not change the body of an already implemented function.
A decorator can be helpful here. \

Extra:
Make use of the time import for calculating the difference in time.

Implementation:
Suppose you have an already implemented function.
Decorate your function such that its execution time is printed when running it.
