Create a program that sorts a list of strings.
Depending on the purpose of the sorting, the criteria of sorting can be different: alphabetically based on the first letter, length of the string, etc.
Use the code template below and implement sorting based on the number of vowels (descending) within a string.
For example, fall will occur before free.


def get_num_of_vowels(inp:str)->int:
    vowel_count = 0
    # todo: implement the body of the function
    return vowel_count

def sort_basedon_vowels():
    cases = ['code','programming','description','fly','free']
    print(sorted(cases)) # todo: fix the call of the function

sort_basedon_vowels()
