Go back to the assignment of week 7.
Your solution probably relies on a dictionary as a data structure that maps keys to values (to encode / decode a text). \

Suppose you are asked to make your solution more generic, so that if the mapping mechanism / algorithm / structure changes in the future, your implementation for the other functions, mainly encoding and decoding, remain without any changes. For example, in the future, instead of a predefined mapping table, the value for a given key is calculated based on an algorithm. Or a different data structure is used instead of a dictionary. \

Update the encode_string and decode_string functions so that instead of a key, they use a function to do the encoding/decoding with.
Remember that encode_string and decode_string encode / decode whole strings, not single characters.\

The encode_function should get the data:str as input
Example:

def encode_string(data: str, encode_function) -> str:
def decode_string(data: str, decode_function) -> str:
